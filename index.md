## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, Part 1
The very first lab we did introduced me to programming and coding, as I had never taken a class like this before. This intro allowed me to express my interest in programming. Setting up my own Linux laptop was also a cool experience.

* Lab 6, Part 1
Part one of Lab Six was different because instead of writing all the code, we only had to input a few things. The sandwich lab was creative, and allowed us to interact with our work. You could make multiple combinations with various inputs.

* Lab 4, Part 1
Lab 4 allowed us to convert units of measurement. This was a lab that had us use different fluid measurements. We used doubles for our functions. Division was also necessary in order to obtain the measurements.
